Simulates, reassembles and phase retrieves a strain-free particle.
Full account is taken of the q-space units, so that the orthogonal
diffraction volume is obtained at the end.

The q-space pixel sizes are kept roughly constant, so that the
assembled volume can be directly phase retrieved afterwards.
